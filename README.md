# IMDb Clone App

## "The best thing to do is to clone an app's functionality the best you can to figure out how it works. Then, use that as inspiration for your own apps." -- A bunch of people on the Internet

This is a clone of the Internet Movie Database using Next JS and The Movie Database API.

### I love movies, so once I get this completed, I would like to use this as inspiration for other movie-themed apps.

## Features
- Styling with Tailwind CSS.
- Top Rated and Trending pages.
- An About page.
- Pages for individual movies.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
